Problem Statement : Creating a movie recommender system using similarity analysis based on plot(storyline / script)  of the movie and not taking the factors of movie genre,director or cast name 
the movie similarity will be done based movie plot when any movie name is entered similar movies will be recommended as output

Developed a Python-based solution to analyze and group movies from an IMDB dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

Key tasks included:
Data Preparation: Loaded and explored the IMDB dataset, preprocessing movie plots through tokenization and lemmatization.
Vectorization & Clustering: Applied TF-IDF for text vectorization and K-means clustering to group similar movies.
Similarity Analysis: Used cosine similarity and hierarchical clustering to identify and recommend movies with similar plots.
Output: Created a user-input feature to find movies similar to a given title based on plot descriptions
